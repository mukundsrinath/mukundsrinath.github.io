I am a second year PhD student in the [College of Information Sciences and Technology](https://ist.psu.edu/) at Pennsylvania State University. I work in the Intelligent Information System Lab headed by [Dr. Lee Giles](http://clgiles.ist.psu.edu/) and in the Human Language Technologies Lab headed by [Dr. Shomir Wilson](https://shomir.net/).  

My research interests lie in the field of natural language processing and information retrieval. I am currently working on the [PrivaSeer](https://privaseer.ist.psu.edu/) project which deals with the analysis, discovery and simplification of web privacy policies.
