> I am a fifth year PhD student in the [College of Information Sciences and Technology](https://ist.psu.edu/) at Pennsylvania State University. My reserach focuses on building scalable information retrieval and natural language processing systems, and making machine learning models trustworthy and fair. 
>  
> I work with [Dr. Lee Giles](http://clgiles.ist.psu.edu/) and [Dr. Shomir Wilson](https://shomir.net/) in analyzing and simplifying privacy policies at scale. I designed and developed [PrivaSeer](https://privaseer.ist.psu.edu/), a one-of-a-kind search engine indexed on over 3.5 million privacy policies.
>
> I work on making machine learning models fair and trustworthy. I am interested in understanding the biases in machine learning models and how to mitigate them.
