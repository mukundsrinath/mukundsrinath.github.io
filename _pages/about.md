> I am a fifth year PhD student in the [College of Information Sciences and Technology](https://ist.psu.edu/) at Pennsylvania State University. My reserach focuses on building scalable information retrieval and natural language processing systems, and making machine learning models trustworthy and fair. 
>  
> I designed and developed [PrivBERT](https://huggingface.co/mukund/privbert) a privacy policy langauge model and [PrivaSeer](https://privaseer.ist.psu.edu), a privacy policy search engine containing over 4 million policies aimed at at making privacy policies more accessible to the public.
> 
> I study biases in socio-technical systems. I designed appraoches to identify implicit and explicit biases in langauge models and identified instances of bias in sentiment analysis and toxicity detection models.
